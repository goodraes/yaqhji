　　对于儿童底名字，生员是处心积虑地想着，但总想不出一个十分的字来。据老妇人底看法，仍旧从“长寿高贵”或“福禄寿喜”里拣一个字，最佳仍旧“寿”字或“寿”承诺义的字，如“其颐”，“彭祖”等。但生员不承诺，觉得太肤浅，随声附和的名字。所以翻开了《易经》，《书经》，向这内里找，但找了半月，一月，还没有恰贴的字。在他底道理：觉得在这个名字内，一面要歌颂儿童，一面要包括他底老而得子底细义，以是竟不简单找。这一天，他一面抱着三个月的婴孩，一面又向书里找名字，戴着一副镜子，将书递到灯底左右去。
　　在小桥流水共婉约的小城里，坐在街边看因夜深而零星的游人来往的我，明白了不一定非要拨剑张驽才能表达爱护自己的情绪，在小城温婉缠绵的垂柳与无尽苍桑的石板路上，保护自己，原来可以做得如此平和自然随心随意。

For children's name, by is deliberately thinking about, but always can't think of a very word.
According to the bottom of the old woman, still from the "noble" longevity or "blessing ShouXi" pick a word, the best is still "longevity" or "long life" promise of righteousness word, such as "h", "the pengzu" and so on.
But by not promises, feel too shallow, the name of the echo.
So open the "book of changes", "the book of history", to find inside it, but to find the half moon, in January, is not just words.
At the end of his truth: think in this name, sing side to children, one side to include his old and number of righteousness, with is not easy to find.
On this day, as he held three months of the baby, and to find the name in the book, wearing a pair of mirror, pass the book to the lights around the bottom.
In small town Bridges, graceful and restrained, sitting in the street to see sporadic visitors by night I coming and going, and understand the doesn't have to dial the sword if to express their emotions, in the town of wen wan lingering weeping willows and endless age to stone road, protect themselves, the original can be so gentle nature at random.
